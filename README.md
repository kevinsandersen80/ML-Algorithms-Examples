# Diabetes dataset
Pre-loaded dataset from Python's Sklearn library for regression <br/>
Dataset consists of ten baseline variables, such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, obtained for 442 diabetes patients. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. <br/>
Clean dataset, no missing values <br/>
Used linear regression machine learning algorithm <br/>

# Titanic dataset (Kaggle)
Downloaded from the popular Kaggle website for data scientists & analysts to practice machine learning techniques <br/>
Predict the survival of the testing dataset based on 10 characteristics such as age, sex, and ticket fare <br/>
Unstructured dataset with missing values <br/>
Used two types of Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) from Python's library: Scikit and XGBoost <br/>
